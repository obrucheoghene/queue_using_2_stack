# Data Structure in C

## Implementation of Queue using two stacks

*This is a simple implementation of a queue data structure using two stacks*

**Stack:** A stack is a linear data structure that allows operation from one end. Operations are carried out in Last in Last out (LIFO) order.


**Queue:**  A queue is a linear data structure that is open on both end. Operations are performed in First in First Out (FIFO) order. It uses one end for insertion and the other for delection.

**Application of Queue**
- CPU scheduling
- Memory management
- Spooling in printer
- Buffer for devices like keyboard

**How to compile and run program**
- gcc main.c -o main
- ./main
